# Optimal tracking strategies in a turbulent flow
The code is written in C language. 
This code is developed to study optimal strategies to catch a lagrangian target in turbulence. Three different heuristic strategies (based on local in time cues of the underlying flow) are implemented and compared with the optimal control solutions. The optimal solutions are found by an iterative forward-backward integration of the Euler-Lagrangian equations of the optimal control problem. 


The Dataset of Lagrangian target trajectories (including positions, velocities, accelerations and fluid gradients along each particle) used in the code are available for download in the Smart-TURB portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it, under the TURB-Lagr repository.
